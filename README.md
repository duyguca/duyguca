Transitioning from the realm of mathematics to coding has been an exhilarating journey for me. With a strong foundation in mathematics and enjoy learning languages and frameworks like  JavaScript, React, React Native, and Next.js, as well as working in WordPress I've successfully contributed to various projects, creating user-friendly interfaces, and developing fast and interactive web applications and mobile apps. Always eager to learn and adapt, I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments, delivering impactful solutions with a blend of analytical thinking and technical proficiency. I'm excited about forging new connections and exploring compelling job opportunities.

Skills: JAVASCRIPT / REACT / REACT NATIVE / NEXT.JS / WordPress / STORYBOOK / REST API /  MongoDB / TAILWIND / SASS / BOOTSTRAP / HTML / CSS
